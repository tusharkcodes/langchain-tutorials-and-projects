The Whisper of Dawn

The night exhales its final sigh,
Stars blink out in a velvet sky.
A hush before the world takes flight,
Dreams dissolve in newborn light.

The wind awakes with gentle grace,
Painting warmth on every face.
Rivers hum their silver tune,
Echoed softly by the moon.

Mountains stretch, their shadows fade,
Secrets stir the forest glade.
Hope returns on wings of gold,
Stories yet to be retold.

Each sunrise writes a promise new,
On skies of pink and trembling blue.
The world begins, the heart reborn—
Life whispers softly: “Welcome, morn.”
